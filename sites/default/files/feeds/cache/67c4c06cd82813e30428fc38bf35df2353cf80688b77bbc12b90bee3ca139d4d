            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*45NrvXpkBUeivaPl0lHs-w.png" /></figure><h3>Identifying key features of successful Payment by results programmes</h3><p>Friday, 13th October 2017</p><p><em>By Cooper Renfro, Associate at Social Finance</em></p><p>“Payment by Results” (PbR) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way to make funding more effective by linking it to measurable results. A number of donor-backed projects with a PbR component have been launched in the global education sector, offering an opportunity to reflect and learn from them. These PbR mechanisms have the potential to allow for greater adaptability in service delivery and for decision-making based on data and evidence,</p><p>But PbR is a generic term. <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> While all PbR funding structures pay a portion or all of programme funding only if pre-defined results are achieved, there are big variations in the way PbR contracts are designed. In some ‘results-based’ funding models, implementers are nevertheless paid a significant portion of their contract value on an input basis (i.e. for activities delivered); in others, implementers are paid ex-post for results but bear the financial risk of results being achieved. In others again, external investors provide up-front working capital and take on the financial risk that results are achieved — a model now popularised as ‘Development Impact Bonds’.</p><p>This range of contracting structures can be stripped down to two basic elements:</p><p>· The proportion of financing to providers where the risk of non-delivery is moved away from the funder (i.e. the risk sits with the service provider or external investors)</p><p>· The extent to which results-based payments are linked to activities, outputs or outcomes.</p><p>In our work at Social Finance in designing PbR instruments, we emphasise the importance of bringing in external investors to bear risk where feasible, and linking payments to outcomes to the extent possible. A common insight from channelling funds in this way is that it requires a cultural shift and changes the way that stakeholders work and think about programme management and implementation. Organisations experimenting with this type of funding model report that organisational changes are occurring. In situations where results are defined as outcomes further along the ‘results chain’ and where delivery flexibility is built into the contract, frontline staff are better able to adapt interventions according to what they observe to be working or not and resources are allocated accordingly, rather than budgets and timeframes being set on pre-agreed activities and milestones.</p><p>This particular approach to PbR also raises questions about programme evaluation. While implementers agree that programme results must be verified independently to ensure credibility of results metrics and payment, there is also agreement that the evaluation methodology, level of rigour and resources dedicated to verifying and evaluating results should vary according to the context and nature of the programme being implemented.</p><p>Building on different experiences of PbR in the education sector, we have sought to bring out key features in PbR contract design which make them most effective. While these features are discussed in the context of PbR experiences in global education, they have much broader application to the use of PbR in other social issue areas.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Focus on outcomes</strong></p><p>As much as possible, programmes should focus on outcomes — for example, in education, outcomes which reflect improved learning and quality education. In this way PbR programmes can mark a real shift away from programmes where key metrics have been activities or outputs (such as number of schools constructed, technologies distributed or teachers trained). In some cases, it will be necessary to measure and possibly pay against intermediate outcome metrics, as it will take more time to observe and evaluate changes in longer term outcomes. Programmes should measure results at a disaggregated level to understand whether outcomes have improved, why and how, and for which populations.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Define results metrics that create the right incentives</strong></p><p>Careful thought is required to define payment metrics in ways that do not create perverse incentives. For example, payments should be linked to progress, not only absolute success in reaching a target or not. Moreover, success metrics and payment triggers should be designed to provide incentives for targeting hard to reach and disadvantaged populations, such as by offering higher payments for services delivered to these populations compared to those easier to reach.</p><p>In early PbR projects, defining outcome metrics has often been challenging and time-consuming. However, practitioners report that centring programmes around these metrics has led to a sharper focus on outcomes throughout implementation. Getting the metrics right generates a better understanding of what works, how, and at what cost, and has value to organisations and the sector beyond individual projects. Moreover, these costs are expected to decrease over time with more experience and sharing of best practices.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Allow implementers flexibility to deliver interventions</strong></p><p>Most development challenges are complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. PbR programme implementers have particularly valued the ability to develop and adapt interventions according to what proves to work or not in specific contexts. This implies building flexibility into contracts to ensure that resources can be reallocated as needed and milestones shifted during the course of the programme to maximise outcomes. In our experience, involving external investors who take on the risk of non-delivery can be a critical element in creating</p><p>a ‘safe space’ for service providers to innovate, learn, iterate and adapt.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Adapt organisational structure and decision-making processes</strong></p><p>PbR approaches involve a cultural and organisational shift within provider organisations to allow intervention adaptation to be informed by frontline staff’s observations of what is or is not effectively improving outcomes. In particular, this requires altering decision-making processes to allow some decisions to be made at a level closer to delivery. These changes in structures and decision-making processes indicate that truly testing a PbR model requires different systems and a different mindset — changes which will require time and patience to embed.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Be clear on government’s role</strong></p><p>Governments are key partners in PbR programmes and should be involved from the beginning of the programme’s design, even if they are not a direct funder. As a first step, governments should be engaged in defining key target populations and outcomes, and in developing an understanding of why alternative approaches have failed to deliver the intended outcomes. Governments can be outcomes funders or co-funders, or gradually take over funding as the PbR model demonstrates proof of concept. Importantly, governments can be involved in selecting and supporting implementers and benefiting from lessons learned about how implementers are performing. Learnings generated from PbR programmes should be shared to inform future government policy decisions and programmes.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Independently and robustly verify outcomes</strong></p><p>In order to ensure clear and credible evidence of outcomes achieved, programme results must be verified by an independent and specialised third party before payments for results are triggered. PbR approaches create incentives for quality data collection, which is critical to the evaluation of programmes and determining what works or not. The exact level of rigour required to link payments to results depends on what is measurable in a specific context and the level of attribution that a particular funder requires.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A wide range of other terms are used to describe this approach, including Results-Based Financing, ‘Pay for Success’, Output-Based Aid and others.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=99216827b809" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/can-payment-by-results-approaches-successfully-improve-education-outcomes-99216827b809">Can payment by results approaches successfully improve education outcomes?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KPID4ndtZae_u0e4YBV4Xg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Tuesday, 12 September 2017</p><p><em>By Dominique Carrie, Associate at Social Finance</em></p><p>In the past few months, a few people have asked me what I was doing on a daily basis at Social Finance and I’ve happily told them about what designing an impact bond requires: thinking through the operational model with the service provider and the government as necessary, carefully developing the payment mechanism that outcomes funders would use to compensate investors for the delivery risk they are taking, building a financial model to determine the required budget and possible terms of investment, reaching out to potential investors, preparing term sheets and contracts with all parties, setting up governance and performance management structures that ensure the success of the project, etc. The list of workstreams and tasks is long and the amount of details that one chooses to provide only depends on the audience, their priorities, and level of interest.</p><p>The reality however is that this list gives an incomplete picture of what our work at Social Finance really is all about: bringing people together and aligning their effort towards the same goal, i.e. tackling a specific social challenge.</p><p>The Kangaroo Mother Care Development Impact Bond (DIB) that Social Finance is designing in partnership with the MaRS Centre for Impact Investing is a good example of the importance and challenge of bringing together various stakeholders. For a bit of background on this project, Kangaroo Mother Care is an evidence-based approach to caring for and saving low-birth-weight and preterm newborns who are particularly fragile. It involves long periods of skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding whenever possible, with the caregivers basically becoming the source of nutrition and warmth for the infant. The DIB aims to scale this method in Cameroon through a train-the-trainer model: the Kangaroo Foundation Cameroon trains Centres of Excellence, which in turn train other regional hospitals, thereby institutionalising KMC expertise in the healthcare system.</p><p>So how many stakeholders are we working with?</p><p>First, a DIB requires outcomes funders to guarantee repayments to an investor if the project is successful (i.e. if agreed metrics have been achieved). This DIB has three committed outcomes funders: the <strong>government of Cameroon</strong> (drawing on funds from the <strong>Global Financing Facility</strong> managed by the <strong>World Bank</strong>), and two Canadian non-profits<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> — <strong>Grand Challenges Canada</strong> (GCC) and <strong>Nutrition International</strong> (NI). We’ve been very lucky on this project to be supported by internal champions in each of those organisations, which has been crucial to move the project forward.</p><p>Second, we need a service provider to implement the project: that’s the <strong>Kangaroo Foundation in Cameroon. </strong>As it is still a young foundation, they continue to be supported by the <strong>Kangaroo Foundation in Colombia</strong>, which has been a crucial partner in developing the project thanks to their long experience and strong technical expertise. We shouldn’t forget also to mention that the government of Cameroon is not only providing funding but is also a key player to collaborate with on the operational side since KMC will be deployed in the public healthcare system. This collaboration involves for example allocating medical staff to our project and ensuring the long-term sustainability of KMC beyond the end of the DIB. We also work with a local consultant, <strong>Abongta Moncha</strong>, who supports us on the ground in our discussions with various stakeholders, including the <strong>twelve hospitals</strong> that will likely participate in the DIB. So when we say that we’re “developing the operational model”, what we really mean is that we’re in constant conversation with stakeholders to understand how to best deploy KMC on the ground, how to navigate the local context, and how to engage people on the front line to ensure the long-term success of the programme.</p><p>Then, you have other organisations providing specific skillsets to this project, including <strong>MaRS Centre for Impact Investing </strong>(our Canada-based partner intermediary), pro-bono legal support (from <strong>Morrison &amp; Foerster </strong>and<strong> Miller Thompson</strong>) and local tax and legal support<strong>. </strong>We’re also in the process of contracting a company to develop a data management system for the project as well as an independent evaluator, who will assess hospital records and other sources of information to determine, objectively, whether outcomes have been achieved during the DIB.</p><p>And this list doesn’t take into account the amazing people we regularly draw knowledge from, including for example the project advisory board, and the potential investors we are currently talking to. We’re indeed looking for an organisation to join the project as an investor and as such provide the upfront required capital of up to $2m USD.</p><p>So we’re looking at more than 15 stakeholders (30+ individuals) from at least 4 different countries to collaborate with and regularly update on the project. This definitely comes with challenges as it takes time to update each individual involved in the project (the time difference doesn’t help) but importantly because it takes time to listen to them, understand where they’re coming from, their points of view and the challenges they face, take into account the cultural differences, learn from their experience and discuss how best to move forward together. Once you manage to do it though, it becomes the most rewarding experience, getting closer, step by step, to launching a life-saving intervention as each piece of the puzzle is finalised and agreed on.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1"><em>[1]</em></a><em> The government of Cameroon has committed $2m USD of funds for this project, while GCC and NI have committed $800k USD each, bringing the total outcomes funding available to $3.6m USD</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3d9573d121f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/scaling-kangaroo-mother-care-in-cameroon-its-all-about-bringing-people-together-3d9573d121f">Scaling Kangaroo Mother Care in Cameroon — It’s all about bringing people together</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday, 12th September 2017</p><p><em>By Cooper Renfro, Associate at Social Finance</em></p><p>As a project team, we’ve spent an impressive 65 days in Ramallah since March of this year, and that’s even after a bothersome (i.e. massive) airline IT failure scuppered a few travel arrangements. Some of us are already on a first name basis with hotel staff and schwarma stand proprietors, yet others of us still manage to embarrass our hosts with our (lack of) pita eating technique.</p><p>It isn’t just the promise of sunny skies, warm weather and hospitality that bring us back. Alongside the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP), the World Bank and DAI, we’re designing a $5m <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/21/results-focused-impact-bonds-can-improve-development-outcomes-by-involving-the-private-sector">Development Impact Bond</a> (DIB) to improve job outcomes for Palestinian youth. The <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/jobs-crisis-palestine-needs-innovative-response?cid=EXT_WBBlogSocialShare_D_EXT">World Bank’s approval of further funding</a> for the Finance for Jobs project means that we’ll be taking a few more trips out in the next months to meet with MOFP, finalise design elements, work with service providers and speak with local investors.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>For some background, unemployment in Palestine is now approaching 30 percent, and remains stubbornly high, especially for youth and women.<a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/world-bank-finance-for-jobs-f4j-13cb1715b472#_ftn1">[1]</a> A number of factors, on both the supply and demand sides, make the transition from education to employment difficult. Palestinian employers have reported that one of the critical barriers to hiring young graduates was a mismatch between the skills they require and those young people currently bring.</p><p>Our research suggests that the skills mismatch cannot be solved simply through the commissioning of additional skills training programmes. Rather, greater coordination, flexibility, adaptation and opportunism need to be at the centre of workforce development, ensuring that employers can effectively signal what skills are needed, and training and skills enhancement can adapt accordingly. This is where we see the DIB coming into play.</p><p>Our team is currently assessing applications from service provider consortia interested in delivering flexible youth training. We’ll soon begin a co-design phase with short-listed applicants during which we’ll refine investment proposals so as to secure investment and start training in Q1 of 2018.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> If you ever have an extra few minutes, feel free to peruse the <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/765751501380068491/West-Bank-and-Gaza-Second-Finance-for-Jobs-Project">Finance for Jobs</a> project documentation.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=13cb1715b472" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/world-bank-finance-for-jobs-f4j-13cb1715b472">Tackling Youth Unemployment in Palestine with the World Bank</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*72gcJdhfGSoUvrIKLe0kRQ.jpeg" /></figure><p><em>Thursday, 24th August 2017</em></p><p><em>By Dan Miodovnik, Associate Director at Social Finance.</em></p><p><strong>We </strong>launched the Peterborough Social Impact Bond to break the relentless cycle of re-offending by short sentenced offenders. To do this, we built a service that addressed their acute need, such as addiction, housing, and health.</p><p>However, we soon faced a peculiar challenge. Once we met their initial needs, people stopped working with us. This would happen regardless of whether they had stopped re-offending. Initially, only 37% of people accessed support for more than 1 month even though we offered it for 12 months.</p><p>We knew that if we were going to have a meaningful impact on their lives, we needed to improve the programme. This is when the CEO, David Hutchison asked me the question — ‘How can we improve the Peterborough Social Impact Bond?’</p><p>To answer it, I turned to data. I started with a simple philosophy — make data useful and never lose sight of the people we were trying to support. To do this, I needed to:</p><p>· <strong>Identify where data can help:</strong> I shadowed staff, met with service users, and visited the prison to understand what decisions the team made and where data and analysis could play a role.</p><p>· <strong>Decide what data to collect:</strong> I watched the team use our case management system and started tweaking to reduce the time they spent on the computer while still collecting the data we needed.</p><p>· <strong>Enable secure access: </strong>I worked with the Police, the prison, and others to enable our case management system to be accessed as and when needed (eg. car, prison, council office etc.).</p><p>· <strong>Build trusted algorithms:</strong> I wanted the team to understand every number, so we sat together and co-designed each calculation.</p><p>· <strong>Create a data culture: </strong>I spent countless hours helping the team incorporate our tools into how they worked and adjusted our analysis and models based on staff and service user feedback.</p><p>For people like Bryan <em>(name has been changed)</em> — our data philosophy meant a more personalised service. Bryan started drinking at 13 and three years later became homeless. He used prison for accommodation, the police for support, and the emergency room as a GP service. He had been in-and-out of prison over 150 times. Now at 57, he could not just stop offending.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/410/1*1iAkFKa-aOJM0FE9rXxM_g.png" /></figure><p>We used data to identify important patterns in Bryan’s reoffending behaviour. These previously went unnoticed because no one collected the right data. Bryan lost his wife at a young age and never recovered. His reputation and fondness for cider meant that no one provided him bereavement support. So every year, he dealt with the anniversary by drinking himself into a bender and ended up in prison for anti-social behaviour.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the anniversary, for example, we made sure that Bryan had access to increased support, particularly psychological counselling. This kept him out of prison and on the journey to breaking his cycle of offending.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/nov/06/good-deals-social-impact-bond">“Through the Peterborough bond, we’ve been able to see really clear trends for the first time. We can see which areas of crime young people are returning to, why people stop engaging with us, how we can stay in contact in a way that’s right for them, and be there for them to turn to if they are heading towards re-offending, as well what work and training are having the most positive effect.” — Evan Jones (Service Manager for St Giles Trust — a Peterborough SIB delivery partner)</a></blockquote><p>Data became part of the service. We were able to track who was doing well and who wasn’t. We could tell if someone’s needs had changed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it earned me the nickname — ‘Data Dan’. As we continued to analyse what each person needed, the service improved — for example, the percentage of service users who accessed support for 1 month improved by 50% and the percentage of those who accessed it for 3 months increased by 100%.</p><p>Armed with data insights, the Peterborough SIB evolved to include over 10 different services such as legal and immigration advice, employment training, behaviour change support, a mental health service and more.</p><h3>The result — a reduction in re-offending of 9% across the programme against a target of 7.5%.</h3><p>The Peterborough SIB showed us the power of data. However, this was just the beginning. At the time, the social and public sectors were skeptical of data and technology. We kept hearing the same stories about products that did not start with the social issue. There needed to be an alternative.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DSoxV-ysC19lkW7YM2EjmQ.png" /></figure><p><strong>We </strong>launched Digital Labs in 2015 to combine our understanding of social issues with digital, data science and product expertise. Together with governments and social organisations, we are developing person-centred approaches to capturing and structuring data and building data science tools to better understand and improve social and public services. Over the next couple months, we are:</p><p>· <strong>Children’s Services Learning Community: </strong>Launching a platform that enables Children’s Services departments to build, share and use tools with the National Pupil Database to improve decision-making and services.</p><p>· <strong>Leaving Well: </strong>Building a digital tool that helps authorities provide the right support to care leavers. It will enable increased accountability and communication between young people and the local authority so that young people can take ownership of their care leaving experience.</p><p>· <strong>Early Help Targeting and Triaging: </strong>Developing a model to help authorities to better target and triage Early Help provision at young people and families who are most at risk of entering care.</p><p>The last six years have been amazing. Who knew that an occasional trip up to Peterborough in 2011 would chart my journey at Social Finance — from the American intern to ‘Data Dan’ to setting up our Digital Labs. I can’t wait to see what impact we’ll have next.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d955e90f705e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/data-story-the-peterborough-social-impact-bond-d955e90f705e">Data Story — The Peterborough Social Impact Bond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday, July 27, 2017</p><p><em>By Tracy Palandjian, CEO and co-founder of Social Finance US</em></p><p>Today’s news out of London on the success of the world’s first Social Impact Bond (SIB) validates what we believed from the start — the alignment of social and financial outcomes is a powerful force for good.</p><p>The Peterborough SIB reduced reoffending of short-sentenced offenders by 9%, exceeding the target of 7.5% set by the contract with the UK Ministry of Justice. As a result, the 17 investors in the Peterborough Social Impact Bond will receive a single payment representing their initial capital plus an amount that will represent a return of just over 3% per annum for the period of investment.</p><p>These results are a testament to our collective commitment to this new public finance tool which aims to deliver measurable results and improve people’s lives. It demonstrates that it is indeed possible for investors to benefit when society does.</p><p>In 2010, when our sister organization Social Finance UK pioneered the Social Impact Bond in Peterborough, they faced a persistent challenge: how to stem reoffending of short-sentenced offenders.</p><p>The solution was simple and elegant: to unite uncommon parties — private investors, government and nonprofits — around a common goal: improving outcomes for individuals and driving measurable, lasting results for communities.</p><p>When the project launched seven years ago there were, understandably, more questions than answers: could SIBs (Pay for Success projects, as we call them here) work in the US? What were the key components to building projects that would have positive outcomes and measurable, enduring impact on peoples’ lives? Was it possible to bring the capital markets, the social sector and the government together around achieving specific social outcomes? How could we ensure that the introduction of a profit motive into civil society work would be force for good, not a road to unintended consequences? What did we need to do to get it right?</p><p>We founded Social Finance US because we were energized by the tool’s potential to change lives for the better. Pay for Success is a distinctive type of impact investment, where returns are generated by creating greater efficiency within governments. Pay for Success shifts the way policymakers allocate scarce resources — helping make government work better for people.</p><p>The promise of the model to respond to social challenges may be limitless. Six years in with a US market of 17 projects mobilizing over $200M in capital. The power of the PFS model reaches across borders, issue areas, policy contexts, and sectors. Increasingly, we believe the model works.</p><p>In our projects from Massachusetts to South Carolina, from New York to Oklahoma and California and Connecticut and beyond — the ripple effect of our work is wide, and it is deep.</p><p>And while we are encouraged by the tremendous progress that has been made both in the UK, the US and globally since Peterborough launched, we also realize it is the first phase in the long arc of building a movement.</p><p>Of course we know there is no guarantee that Pay for Success projects will create the social impact they intend. There are risks involved. It is the transfer of risk from the public sector to the private sectorthat makes this model so meaningful for government.</p><p>We and our fellow travelers in the PFS movement continue to build and nurture the field, and to refine and expand the model. And we continue to learn and be inspired by the efforts of our colleagues.</p><p>It will take another decade or more to know whether Pay for Success will achieve the level of change we seek. We believe it can reorient the way governments allocate resources toward outcomes and that it can mobilize private capital to accelerate that transition. Until then, each project brings us an opportunity to serve more people, collaborate with new partners and gain more knowledge to assess and refine the model.</p><p>Even so, today’s news brings us one step closer to this goal. In a time of global change and uncertainty, Pay for Success is one part of the solution. Robert F. Kennedy once said of the GDP that “it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”</p><p>It is difficult to measure social progress. We can measure capital invested, projects launched, and people served. But the real question is — how do you measure a life better lived?</p><p>Pay for Success is one public finance tool to do that — and following today’s positive news on Peterborough — we are eager to write the next chapter of Pay for Success.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bb9d0b737d9c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/worlds-first-social-impact-bond-shows-positive-results-bb9d0b737d9c">World’s First Social Impact Bond Shows Positive Results</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday, 27th July 2017</p><p><em>By David Robinson — chair of the Peterborough SIB Advisory board and led Gordon Brown’s Council on Social Action</em></p><p>It was back in 2008 that this journey began. The incoming Prime Minister encouraged his new Council on Social Action to find innovative funding models, the Sainsbury Foundation responded with a modest grant to the then infant Social Finance and SF embarked on the exploration of an idea that was first christened Contingent Revenue Bonds.</p><p>Despite the PM’s support Treasury officials were not immediately convinced. They worried that returns would be too low and fail to attract investment. Then they worried that returns would be too high and an unnecessary liability for the tax payer. They thought that a pilot would be too small to demonstrate any capacity for savings. Then they thought that a big rollout would be too risky for an idea that was untried.</p><p>It was a patient negotiation driven with passion, commitment and skill by the Social Finance team. Arrangements with the Ministry of Justice weren’t ultimately finalised until the closing weeks of the Brown government. Agreement before the election felt important but we needn’t have worried. The new PM was, if anything, even more supportive of the idea.</p><p>This political support was necessary but it also carried a price. Scrutiny would be intense and expectations high, some unreasonably so. Social Impact Bonds don’t, as some seemed to believe, replace public funding and they can’t make up for expenditure cuts but they do have a useful part to play. We need innovation in the social sector. Innovation incurs risk and is inherently difficult for public funders. The SIB is a mechanism for funding innovation, ultimately and if successful, from the public purse but at no risk to the tax payer.</p><p>Like any other kind of early stage investment some would succeed and some wouldn’t but for the sake of the model it was very important indeed that the first one worked. Political support, and indeed investor confidence and practitioner goodwill would evaporate very quickly if Peterborough failed.</p><p>That’s why I am particularly pleased with the financial and social results that have been announced today. The Peterborough Social Impact Bond reduced reoffending of short-sentenced offenders by 9% overall compared to a national control group. This exceeds the target of 7.5% set by the Ministry of Justice and the Big Lottery Fund. Seven years later the 17 investors in the Peterborough Social Impact Bond will receive back their capital investment together with a small return.</p><p>This first, £5m programme was relatively small but with it we have shown the importance and the value of long — term impact driven funding. The multi-agency intervention providing responsive and sustained assistance to people stuck in the reoffending loop has worked, it has provided appropriate reward for our risk taking partners and, most important of all, it has shown the transformative power of high quality, often peer led, support for determined people in difficult circumstances.</p><p>Others have adopted and adapted the funding design — there are now 89 SIB financed projects mobilising more than £300m of investment in 19 countries,</p><p>I have one major regret. The MoJ decided to cancel the final cohort in our three cohort programme because the new “transforming rehabilitation” reforms were introduced. In my mind, it made no sense to curtail an innovative project when the learning was unfinished and it was a particularly frustrating that rumours wafted out that the SIB was unsuccessful when the opposite was true. We lost the opportunity to build on our own learning and there remains a deep frustration that more of the operating model was not incorporated into the new national rehabilitation programme.</p><p>Today’s results won’t make up for the lost momentum or, restore the momentum we had built in Peterborough. But I hope that they do banish any lingering doubts about the first SIB funded project. Social Impact Bonds never were, and never will be, the answer to everything but the Peterborough project was a very good start. I am grateful to all who played a part at every stage in the journey.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=debbc704cfc7" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/the-peterborough-sib-reflections-from-david-robinson-debbc704cfc7">The Peterborough SIB: Reflections from David Robinson</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Early indicators had been positive but it’s great to hear that <a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/resources/press-releases/">reconvictions are down by 9%.</a></p><p>This project oozed innovation and it was so exciting to be part of it. It was a tough gig as we were measured on all releases, regardless of whether they chose to engage with the service. The team of staff and volunteers were incredible though, as were our local partners, so it is no surprise to find that we had a positive impact. You often hear people talk about multi-agency working but I’d never experienced it quite like this before. The fact that we had seven years, a flexible budget and one outcome, to reduce crime, resonated with agencies across the spectrum and their buy-in was fantastic.</p><p>Our clients faced multiple barriers and often had entrenched behaviour patterns so this journey wasn’t an easy one. I am so proud of the way clients embraced the opportunities and made efforts to change their lives. It was really exciting to see them open up and engage with the service. Some took time to build trust, and progress was slow and steady over several years. This reinforces my view that projects like this need to be long term, so we can establish meaningful relationships and integrate fully into the local landscape. It was really hard work and at times immensely frustrating but it’s great to know that it worked.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e64ed07a0ed" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/the-one-service-delivers-results-for-peterborough-prisoners-e64ed07a0ed">The One Service delivers results for Peterborough prisoners</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday, 11th July 2017</p><p><em>By Tom Corfield, Manager at Social Finance</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c40Wf4pl5Z1r_-LcYUIzUw@2x.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>Use medieval map drawing techniques to find the scariest bits of your product…</blockquote><p>It’s really hard being the new person working on a product. Particularly if you’re an engineer. You’ve got to learn to understand and work with a code base that you didn’t write. If you’re lucky, someone else in the team did write it. But if you’re unlucky, and you’re working on a legacy code base, there are whole black boxes of code that nobody on the team understands.</p><p>‘Here Be Dragons’ is a short workshop I’ve been using for a while to get everyone (myself included) talking about the bits of the product that scare them the most. The idea is stolen from medieval map map makers: the maps they were making were generally for sailors and aimed to map out the whole world.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*hLg2k2nYpAQYpQBMjGSG8A.png" /><figcaption>A ‘Mappa Mundi’ — creds to the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/map1.html">British Library</a></figcaption></figure><p>But the problem was that there were whole bits of the world that nobody had discovered yet, and other bits where the maps were hazy at best. So map makers had to fill in these unknown areas, or they’d have an embarrassing blank bit of map. So instead of making it up, they filled the unknown spaces with pictures of mythical beasts and labelled it something along the lines of ‘Here Be Dragons’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/576/1*_uMlHE9DAzFQoaE166levA.png" /><figcaption>Whimsical Beast — creds to the <a href="http://blogs.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/2013/08/whimsical-sea-monsters.html">British Library</a></figcaption></figure><p>Which, as you can imagine, probably deterred quite a lot of sailors from going and exploring those parts of the map! It would have been much better for the explorers if the map makers had instead said ‘you know what, we don’t know — go find out and then tell us!’ The double benefit being that probably someone who sees the map will have been there or at least near there, and can start to help fill in the gaps.</p><p>This workshop is the product equivalent of this exercise:</p><blockquote>Everyone maps out where they think the dragons are, and then we work out how we’re going to slay them together.</blockquote><p>Initially this started out as a workshop for engineers working on products. But actually it works well in any situation where you’re trying to get a group of people talking about the risks and unknowns around what they’re doing.</p><p>Often it’s hard to have the conversation where you admit that you don’t understand something. It’s even harder as a team to acknowledge that none of you understand it. Probably everyone in the team knows that nobody knows… but you’d rather not talk about it…</p><p>Maybe if you leave the black box alone for long enough maybe it will just die. But this is a massive risk to your product. <strong>The scary truth is that usually the black box is doing something quite important. </strong>And if it broke your product would die. These are the dragons your team needs to slay to stop you all having nightmares.</p><h3>Here’s how the workshop works</h3><p>It can take as little as 30 mins, but I’d suggest taking longer if the conversations are good.</p><p>You will need:</p><ul><li>Nice big bits of paper</li><li>Coloured pens (and glitter and anything else you need to be creative.</li></ul><h3>Step 1 — draw your maps (5mins)</h3><p>Everyone on the team draws out their own pirate map of the product. That could be from a feature perspective, a code base perspective, external forces that operate on your product… whatever works for you, or a mash up of everything, as you like. Get creative. I think this works best when people genuinely draw it like an old treasure map, with an island, sharks, treasure and, of course, Sea Monsters. And attribute each bit of the map to a feature, bit of the code, external risk… etc</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rxC3JcTR6d4c1sCrwXDsBg@2x.jpeg" /><figcaption>A classic ‘Treasure Island’ approach</figcaption></figure><h3>Step 2 — tell your stories, find your heroes (15 mins)</h3><p>Each member of the team talks through their map and explains the nature of their dragons and why they think they’re dragons.</p><p>Hopefully this is the moment when your hero will step forward out of the darkness. “Don’t worry about a thing” she’ll say “I know how that works — I’ll save you from the dragon!”</p><p>If this doesn’t happen, you might want to prompt the group… surely someone knows SOMEthing?</p><p>But if it’s really true, and nobody knows anything about the dragon… well that’s pretty good to know right? And now you need to mint yourself a fresh hero — who’s going to step up and take this dragon down. Or maybe you’re going to tackle it as a team…</p><h3>Step 3 — Draw in your heroes</h3><p>Everyone on the ream draws their heroes onto their maps. Ideally in heroic poses battling with the dragons. Make sure the names of the heroes have a name tag.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/628/1*5w4LlRGg9VX93nvZPVFGYA@2x.jpeg" /><figcaption>Heroes taking down a Dragon</figcaption></figure><h3>Step 4 — take action!</h3><p>Use your maps as prompts in team meetings and planning sessions. Make sure they’re a talking point on every agenda until all of the team’s dragons have been slayed and all the scary bit of your maps are scary no more.</p><h3>An added benefit of this workshop:</h3><p>Your Dragon areas are inherently unknowns. If your team aren’t sure about them… and maybe previous team members weren’t sure about them… you can guarantee that these will be contributing to your technical debt . If they’ve not already, successive developers will be likely to engineer around the problem creating layers and layers of obfuscation. This is a great opportunity to stop the rot.</p><p>(Thanks to Dave, Anneka and Matthew for letting me use their maps!)</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b7c550b45d33" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/here-be-dragons-de-risk-your-product-b7c550b45d33">Here Be Dragons: de-risk your product</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Charities have been unsurprisingly quick to realise the strength of this opportunity, capitalising on the powerful match funding incentive to raise funds for their causes. With the implementation of charity-led improvements to the campaign, appetite can only be set to continue to grow.</strong></p><p><strong>Leveraging the power of match funding for your cause</strong></p><p>The Big Give, an online donation platform that specialises in match funding campaigns, is celebrating its 10 year anniversary this year. To mark the occasion, the Big Give will be working with charities to raise even more money than in previous years. This is no mean feat when you learn that its flagship campaign, the <a href="https://www.thebiggive.org.uk/christmas-challenge/">Christmas Challenge</a>, has raised over £78 million for more than 2,800 charity projects since it launched. Last year over £7.2 million was raised in just 7 days when over 300 charities worked together to simultaneously raise funds for their causes.</p><p><strong>How the campaign works</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, online donations to participating charities are doubled by funds secured in the run up to the campaign. These funds come from two sources: a Champion (a Trust, Foundation, Philanthropist or Corporate sourced by the Big Give) and Pledgers (charities’ major supporters). Charities use this matching pot to double donations made online during the campaign which kicks off on #GivingTuesday. The Christmas Challenge stands out because it so neatly brings together all types of charity supporters into one campaign, allowing charities to develop multiple income streams as they raise funds.</p><p>Charities are responsible for selecting a project to fundraise for, and marketing this to their supporters. In 2016, these projects collectively raised an impressive £1.3m for the international development sector. Send A Cow, who won 1st prize in our Christmas Challenge Awards which recognised the most successful charities taking part in the campaign, have spoken about their experience:</p><p><em>We were really excited to take part in The Big Give Christmas Challenge because we knew from previous experience that matched funding can be popular. However we were really amazed at how all our audiences got behind the campaign from individuals to churches and volunteers. It was so positive to see how an integrated channel approach to drive online response worked so well with what is, in the main, a direct mail recruited audience. For pledgers, encouraging others to support Send a Cow was very rewarding and deepened their relationship with us, particularly as we could talk to them throughout the campaign and with feedback afterwards. We are now successfully taking this learning into creating more matched funding opportunities across our Individual and major donor programmes as a result. ~ Vickie Wood, Head of Individual Giving at Send a Cow</em></p><p><strong>The evolution of the Christmas Challenge</strong></p><p>The Christmas Challenge campaign has evolved since its conception in order to improve the experience for charities and donors alike. Significant changes to the model were successfully trialed in 2016 following an extensive charity consultation. For the first time, match funds were ring-fenced for participating charities according to their own individual fundraising targets. This ensured that funds lasted longer than in previous years when charities had been competing with each other. Secondly, the campaign was simplified by the release of all match funding in one go so that a donation could be doubled at any time during the campaign. In previous years there had been a stop-start structure to the campaign, necessary because of its competitive nature. The Big Give also removed the fees for charities to ensure even greater value for money for those taking part.</p><p><strong>The results</strong></p><p>The changes have made a significant positive impact on the benefit to charities, which corresponds to research commissioned by the Big Give in 2016 (<a href="https://cdn.thebiggive.org.uk/static/docs/A-Great+Match-EVersion.pdf">see full report</a>). Survey results show that match funding helps to:</p><p>● Get more people giving — 95% of charities who took part in the 2016 campaign received donations from new supporters</p><p>● Get people giving more — 63% said that current supporters gave more than they usually would.</p><p>● Build fundraising capacity — the benefits go beyond the financials with 83% increasing their confidence in fundraising.The Big Give provides coaching and resources in order to help charities make the most of the opportunity.</p><p><strong>Join the movement of online match funding</strong></p><p>Charities can apply for the Christmas Challenge 2017 by visiting <a href="https://www.thebiggive.org.uk/christmas-challenge/">theBigGive.org.uk/christmas-challenge</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=706ea2c0e6ff" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/match-funding-the-perfect-christmas-present-for-charities-706ea2c0e6ff">Match funding: The perfect Christmas present for charities?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvyC-qmNGrTzhmCj67D7tg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Friday, 16th June 2017</p><p><em>By Chris Clements, Director at Social Finance</em></p><p>This week is Refugee Week, and a lot of things will be said — both positive and negative, conjuring up many associations. For me however, it’s all about people.</p><p>There are currently an unprecedented 21 million refugees in the world, and with over 34,000 people being displaced each day, it is no wonder this has been widely called the worst humanitarian crisis of our generation. In the UK, we currently provide protection to around 16,000 people a year. Over the past 18 months, I’ve been researching the issue deeply through my work in Social Finance’s Impact Incubator, trying to understand this complex issue and what more can be done in the UK.</p><p>At Social Finance we often look to the outcomes, and if you look hard at this topic it can make uncomfortable reading in terms of the opportunities we enable for refugees in this country. The majority face destitution in the months <em>after</em> being given protection, with many facing homelessness. Close to 2 years later more than 60% have lower levels of English language skill and have worse health outcomes than UK nationals, with stress, anxiety and depression being commonly reported. Unemployment rates are 50% and of those that are working over a third are on temporary contracts, and half are overqualified for their jobs. Refugees report experiences of racism and segregation and 1 in 4 spend no leisure time with British nationals. In short, more needs to be done. That’s why we’re excited to be helping develop a promising approach that’s new to the UK: <strong>community sponsorship.</strong></p><p>As I’ve led Social Finance’s work, the thing that has struck me over and over is the humanity of it. Refugees are just people caught up in terrible situations, seeking sanctuary and stability. I’ve heard stories like the Ayo family, who fled the conflict in Syria and endured loss and suffering but are now rebuilding their lives in Coventry, hoping for a new future for their teenage children. Nor, trying to put physical and mental trauma behind her. Mahmoud, who just wants to learn English, to ‘stand on my own two feet and do things for myself, to understand this new society I live in and start a new business’. Each of these names — and countless others — have a unique, difficult story behind them.</p><p>However, the communities in which refugees seek to build new lives are also just groups of people. Families, organisations, politicians with desires, aspirations, fears, and yes, prejudices. But also warmth, compassion, energy and resources — as evidenced by the continued engagement by wide swaths of civil society. People like Nick and his fellow church members in Merton, helping prepare a home by painting and decorating it, ready for a newly arrived family. Mary and her friends in the book club in Cornwall who have come together to support a refugee family. As I’ve spoken to numerous people across the UK, I’ve seen first-hand a huge desire to do more. This energy needs to be mobilised in an effective, sustainable way.</p><p>Community sponsorship does this — enabling local people to take responsibility for resettling a refugee family, supporting and empowering them to rebuild their lives. Over its long track record in Canada, the approach has improved outcomes for refugees and made communities more welcoming. Social Finance is therefore working closely with civil society groups and government to help achieve its potential in the UK.</p><p>During Refugee Week, there will be more evidence presented on the scale of the issue in the UK — but there will also be opportunities profiled to do something about them. We are starting to put in place the infrastructure and training required for sponsorship, and next week with our partners we are launching some new resources to encourage its growth.</p><p>But I’ll always remember that what we’re doing is connecting people.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a7abf7be4207" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/refugee-week-2017-19-25-june-2017-a7abf7be4207">Refugees: Enabling people-based solutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monday, 19th February 2018</p><p><em>By Nita Colaco, Associate Director at Social Financ</em>e</p><p>There is currently a vibrant debate around performance-based financing in middle- and low-income countries. Questions have been raised around its ability to sit alongside long-term, sustainable impact, with <a href="http://gh.bmj.com/content/3/1/e000664#xref-ref-4-1">some authors</a> cautioning that it’s more “donor fad” than driven by country governments or national priorities and, at worst, can cause harm by diverting valuable resources away from real reforms.</p><p>We at Social Finance are interested in contributing to this conversation. For example, Emilie Dussauge has <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/can-payment-by-results-approaches-successfully-improve-education-outcomes-99216827b809">written previously</a> about the key features of successful PBF programmes — namely a focus on outcomes (rather than project activities or outputs, which may naturally change over time), metrics that create the right incentives, flexibility for implementers to deliver interventions, adaptation of organisational structures and decision-making processes, government’s crucial role, and independent verification of outcomes.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/development-impact-bonds-briefing-note.pdf#overlay-context=resources/publications">Development Impact Bonds</a> (DIBs) are another important input into this debate. DIBs are promising new multi-stakeholder models to deliver outcomes more efficiently and effectively. In a DIB, private investors pay upfront for services and work, typically through a DIB Manager, with delivery organisations to achieve results. Outcomes funders (typically country governments and / or multilateral donors or foundations), repay the investors — plus a financial return — if the programme successfully achieves pre-agreed outcomes. If the programme achieves more results than expected, investors can receive a higher financial return — up to a sensible cap.</p><p>DIBs are still a new instrument. Since 2015, four have been launched targeting health, education, and economic empowerment outcomes, and many more are in development in a variety of issue areas, including the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/21/results-focused-impact-bonds-can-improve-development-outcomes-by-involving-the-private-sector">World Bank’s first DIB</a> under design by Social Finance.</p><p><strong>The advantages of impact investment</strong></p><p>A key difference between DIBs and traditional PBF is the introduction of external impact investment. This is beneficial in two ways — firstly, it can lead to more flexibility, innovation, and rigour in development programmes and secondly, it can enable a broader range of organisations to take part in programme delivery.</p><p><em>Flexibility, innovation and rigour</em></p><p>In any successful PBF programme, operations should be able to be adapted in a flexible way, such that implementation can be tailored to a specific country context, rather than just trying to scale up a mainstream, donor-driven approach that might or might not be suited to the country’s circumstances. But how can one imbed flexibility and innovation into programmes themselves, particularly when trialling new interventions or scaling up interventions that have proved successful only in limited settings?</p><p>At Social Finance, we’ve seen that the introduction of external impact investment, alongside a focus on outcomes, is critical to ensuring operations can be adapted in a flexible way. Private investors generally expect that programmes need to be continuously adjusted based on learnings about what works and what doesn’t. Accordingly, investors often give a DIB Manager the latitude to make necessary changes quickly and efficiently. Bespoke data collection tools may be necessary, but they should always be designed to enable adaptive performance management and independent verification of outputs and outcomes.</p><p><em>Broadening the range of delivery partners</em></p><p>Because upfront financing is provided by investors rather than delivery bodies, DIBs allow smaller or community-based organisations, who are often more attuned to the local context, to deliver big projects without having to take on working capital risk. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/supplier-access-to-prefinance-in-payment-by-results-contracts">DFID’s recently commissioned report on PBF</a> cites pre-financing, or the funding delivery organisations need to operate before being paid for results, as a key challenge to PBF which means that “organisations with large unrestricted reserves” or “private companies with financial track record” are more likely to bid for PBF programmes, whereas “small organisations” and “those from the charitable sector” are likely to be left out.</p><p>In addition, because investors are putting in the upfront financing, the financial incentives in a DIB are targeted towards them (in the form of a potential return on investment), not at delivery organisations. This means that DIBs can also help to reduce perverse incentives that might unintentionally be created when cash-strapped delivery organisations are paid back only upon success.</p><p><strong>Focusing on priorities</strong></p><p>DIBs will only be successful in as much as they address real country priorities and involve <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2018/02/01/from-davos-is-paying-for-results-with-blended-finance-ready-to-take-off/">national and regional actors</a> in the design and development process. As much as possible, we encourage country governments to be involved as outcomes funders to increase their ownership of the programmes. In the <a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/projects/cameroon-kangaroo-mother-care">Cameroon Newborn DIB</a> we have been designing with our partners at <a href="https://impactinvesting.marsdd.com/">MaRS Centre for Impact Investing</a> and <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.ca/">Grand Challenges Canada</a>, the Government of Cameroon (drawing upon the World Bank-managed <a href="https://www.globalfinancingfacility.org/">Global Financing Facility</a>), has committed to pay for key health and nutrition outcomes for low birth weight and pre-term infants alongside <a href="https://www.nutritionintl.org/">Nutrition International</a> and Grand Challenges Canada.</p><p>DIBs tend to have a multitude of partners, and identifying and aligning operational models to address different priorities can take time, but bringing different types of stakeholders together and guiding them through the DIB design process is a key component of what we at Social Finance do. As Dominique Carrie writes, in reference to our work designing the Cameroon Newborn DIB, “<a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/scaling-kangaroo-mother-care-in-cameroon-its-all-about-bringing-people-together-3d9573d121f">it’s all about bringing people together</a>”.</p><p><strong>Enabling sustainable change</strong></p><p>What about providing for long-term change and systemic reforms? Sustainability is a key focus of DIBs, and should be for any development programme. Capacity building of implementing partners and other key stakeholders is critical, and a main function of the DIB Manager. There are often other ways to build sustainability into DIBs. In the Cameroon Newborn DIB, for example, we are working to scale an evidence-based neonatal intervention — Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) — to low birth weight and pre-term infants in public hospitals. We are in discussions with the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health to provide the base salary for KMC staff in the hospitals we are working in, to ensure buy-in from the beginning and make it as financially sustainable as possible after the DIB.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In conclusion, a DIB is surely not the right solution for every issue, but it can provide for tailored, innovative solutions to meet pressing needs and can add to the important debate about what makes an effective, sustainable programme.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dfdabfcb2574" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/rethinking-performance-based-financing-dfdabfcb2574">Rethinking Performance-based financing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday, 9th February 2018</p><p><em>By Andy Smith, Associate at Social Finance &amp; Hannah Jump, Analyst at Social Finance</em></p><p>Leaving Well is a new programme that aims to improve outcomes for the 11,000 young people who leave care every year. At the core of the approach is a digital tool that will put care leavers at the heart of decisions about their future. As well as allowing young people to own their plan to independence, the tool will make it easier for young people to communicate with their case workers (personal adviser), whilst also freeing up personal adviser time. Managers will be able to gain valuable information from the tool, to help them structure the support that their teams can offer.</p><p><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p><p>Whilst we have done a lot of research into why outcomes for young people leaving care are poor, we wanted a deeper understanding of what happens on the front line. Between May and September 2017 we partnered with Leeds City Council, Southampton City Council and The London Borough of Havering to gain an understanding of the leaving care process for both young people and the staff that support them.</p><p>In this phase of work we discovered that there are gaps and weaknesses in the leaving care system which make it difficult for services to support young people to independence. Specifically, there is a lack of data to drive decision making within leaving care teams. Young people have identified specific areas where they would like more targeted support, particularly when planning for their future:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*A_zp3osFWVuOZ3rchJBngw.png" /></figure><p>These findings were backed up with evidence from interviews with young people and professionals, analysis of over 50 pathway plans, 903 data, as well as self-assessment reviews from personal advisers across all our local authorities. This meant that whilst none of these findings surprised our partnering authorities, our analysis added even more rigour to their current assumptions.</p><p><strong>How will the digital tool make a difference?</strong></p><p>Our findings revealed that young people want to have their ambitions, needs and feelings heard. Local authorities need to be able to understand what works for young people based on real-time outcomes data, so that they can make informed strategic decisions about the support that young people receive</p><p>In order for the digital tool to have a real impact it must:</p><p>· Enable young people to create and ‘own’ their plan to independence, with frequent targeted help from their support network.</p><p>· Enable personal advisers to provide more frequent, better support and communications to young people, by freeing up their time.</p><p>· Provide accurate timely information to local authorities, so they can target support more effectively on the most vulnerable and needy.</p><p>· Support young people to develop and achieve high aspirations</p><p>The tool will work in the following way:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*Um7Azy0BlLvqoJQJPz6Mxg.png" /></figure><p>We know that not everyone has a phone or computer, so personal advisers and young people can review and update the plan via any web browser (on phone, tablet or computer). Mini surveys will enable young people to give instant feedback on how they are doing. At the same time, PAs can keep young people updated on their progress automatically, so young people know what is going on.</p><p><strong>How do we ensure that this is useful for young people and their personal advisers?</strong></p><p>We are developing our tool using an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/05/04/innovation-applying-inspect-adapt-to-the-agile-manifesto/#5cfc1c9468b1">Agile</a> development process. This iterative approach enables us to design something that meets user needs. It puts the user at the centre of the design process, and we can learn from their needs at every step.</p><p>This involves:</p><p>1. Building a simple feature in two weeks</p><p>2. Testing the feature with some end users (PAs and young people)</p><p>3. Updating the tool based on the feedback we hear</p><p>To start, we tested ways of collecting information on how well young people were doing, as well as how we could increase accountability between young people and their PA, and free up PA time.</p><p>Test 1 — Collecting rich management information using the Outcomes Framework</p><p>We have developed an Outcomes Framework (<a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/resources/publications/leaving-well-outcomes-framework-promote-successful-transitions-care-leavers">see here</a>) to produce outcomes based management information. In order for this to be used in practice it must be useful. We tested how young people and PAs found using this.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/532/1*U_UuQED5avapRbzJz_KaEw.png" /></figure><p>The Outcomes Framework is a hierarchy of needs. Each domain in this hierarchy is scored based on a series of specific questions chosen as good indicators of positive outcomes. The questions in the framework act as an assessment of the young person’s current situation across the key domains: Housing, Health and Wellbeing, Relationships, Positive Activities, Finance and Employment, Education &amp; Training. To test the value of this approach we asked PAs to work with their young people and complete a spreadsheet based version of the Framework.</p><p>From the test we gained valuable insights:</p><p>- The data produced from this process provides rich insights to managers about the status of all young people in their team, and where they need the most support</p><p>- Young people liked working through the questions with their PA, to chat about what was going well, and where they could use more support.</p><p>Test 2 — Using a shared to-do-list to populate a pathway plan</p><p>Our second test was designed to get feedback on a pathway plan that was automatically populated from a shared to-do-list. Ultimately, we wanted to see if this would free up PAs time. The to-do-list (see below) enables PAs and young people to add and tag actions with a specific domain, so they could be grouped together on the final plan.</p><p>From this feedback we learned:</p><p>- Young people and PAs value the accountability that comes with a shared to-do-list</p><p>- PAs value a more action focused pathway plan.</p><p>- The to-do-list reduces the time taken to type up notes into the case management system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/183/1*p3o-jh3I3qHgM2lE3Z3L_A.png" /></figure><p>Our next tests will involve getting more young person feedback on the look and feel of the tool, as well as understanding how useful live status check-ins are for users.</p><p>Users in our partner local authorities have taught us an invaluable amount over the past few months. With each test we run we gain new insights that re-shape the tool and direct its future development; it is our users who are determining the direction of the product. At every step we are getting closer to making something which meets the needs of young people leaving care, and supports them to better outcomes. By the end of March our digital tool will be used by young people and their personal advisors in our three partner local authorities.</p><p>Our goal is to make a sector wide impact. Therefore, this summer we are looking to partner with an additional five local authorities. This will enable us to extend our reach to even more young people, whilst learning from their experiences in the leaving care system. This would be an opportunity to help shape the tool as we continue to develop it.</p><p><strong>If you would be interested in working with us to transform the pathway planning process, please get in touch via:</strong></p><p><a href="mailto:leavingwell@socialfinance.org.uk">leavingwell@socialfinance.org.uk</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=898203595478" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/better-outcomes-for-care-leavers-leaving-well-digital-tool-898203595478">Better Outcomes for Care leavers: ‘Leaving Well’ Digital Tool</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday, 2nd February 2018</p><p><em>By Social Finance</em></p><p>Late last year, we spent a week in Botswana alongside Peek Vision to build up our understanding of the challenges of improving eye health for children on a national scale. The visit informed our work supporting Peek Vision to replicate their National Eye Health Programme internationally, through exploring the potential of an outcomes-based agreement.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/240/1*YrNpGi2WVJJoOVJYD9xSIw.png" /><figcaption><em>Testing the eye-health screening app. <br> Photo: Chan Voong and Laura Colagrande</em></figcaption></figure><p>We began the in-country mission by assessing the scale of the challenge in Botswana, where around one in 50 Batswana suffer from untreated visual impairment (VI).</p><p>Peek, which is helping to facilitate Botswana’s National Eye Health School Screening Programme, estimates that about 50,000 children require treatment for eye health conditions and 30,000 of them could have their conditions resolved with spectacles.</p><p>Stakeholders at the Ministry of Basic Education tell us how these children are at risk of achieving poor learning outcomes and are sometimes wrongly perceived as slow learners in the absence of a diagnosis.</p><p>This is the first of multiple social costs of untreated visual impairment that can lead to poor psychosocial and economic outcomes as a child grows up.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/446/1*qtrLR7TBuDfzIq_wTg34ZA.png" /><figcaption><em>Game and Katlego from the Botswana-UPenn Partnership demonstrating the Peek vision app — which facilitates eye-health screening at minimal unit cost</em></figcaption></figure><p>50,000 is a striking number for a middle-income country, particularly when we consider that Botswana has the highest per capita ratio of eye care human resource in Africa yet also has the third highest prevalence of blindness and VI.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>So what is causing so many children to suffer from untreated eye health issues in a middle-income country?</p><p>We know that it is not because these conditions are untreatable. Research commissioned by the Government of Botswana shows that patients can be treated with simple spectacles or eye drops in 85% of cases.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p><p>Instead, it might be to do with the fact that many children live in rural areas, while optometrists and other eye specialists are concentrated around cities.</p><p>We hear from the children’s nurse at Scottish Livingstone Hospital, in Molepolole, South-East Botswana, that there is a broader information problem, where many families, particularly outside the large cities, are unaware that refractive services exist or might be accessible. She tells us how she sometimes approaches parents of children in her local community, when she can spot the child’s myopia in their behaviour.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/597/1*uIv9pV53M2E3SSc7mEtfjA.png" /><figcaption><em>Scottish Livingstone Hospital</em></figcaption></figure><p>Not only this, but a poor child living in a rural area would struggle to meet the costs of eye tests even if they were accessible, with only three of the country’s 50 optometrists practising in the public sector.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/507/1*pnJWzeP5IFk1tSYLRQOaEw.png" /><figcaption><em>Eye clinic at the Scottish Livingstone Hospital.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ben Jupp, Director, Social Finance</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*odwfye0kTlFFwsf3C9IhcA.jpeg" /></figure><p>Last week, the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness launched its final report, further raising the profile of an issue whose impact on health and wellbeing was for insufficiently recognised for many decades. As government, civil society and businesses seek to grapple with this complex social issue, my hope is that we can look imaginatively at responses; through a dual strategy of supporting those who do become chronically lonely to reconnect with others and fostering a society which helps prevent loneliness in the first place.</p><p>My interest in loneliness and social isolation arose by chance about twenty years ago when I was given a book called <em>Heatwave. </em>A relatively obscure PhD thesis looking at a heatwave in Chicago had been written up as a surprising engaging book, mapping out the harmful consequences of sustained hot weather on elderly patients. The first conclusion was that the premature death of scores of older people remained below the national news radar compared to most natural disasters. But an equally important second conclusion was that far fewer members of the relatively well-connected Latino communities died, compared to much more isolated African American and white working class communities. Social connections can make the difference between life and death.</p><p>What I didn’t realise at the time was that this impact goes far beyond the importance of neighbourliness and social support in a time of acute need. As a group of campaigners, public health experts, charities and older people themselves have been highlighting for the past few years, loneliness and isolation matters to our health in all sorts of ways. As the Jo Cox Commission notes, loneliness can increase blood pressure and heart disease, depression and cognitive decline. The Commission reinforces the message of the Campaign to End Loneliness and others: that the impact of loneliness on mortality and morbidity is similar to that of smoking, excessive drinking or failing to exercise.</p><p>So how should we respond? Whilst this continued focus on loneliness is welcomed, it doesn’t feel as if we have yet formulated a full response as a society. Is the detrimental impact of loneliness just something which should prompt us to take more care of our more family and friends? Is it something where government could or should have a role? The Commission suggests some ideas but also passes that challenge over to others to work through.</p><p>It’s a question which I and others at Social Finance have been reflecting on over the last three years as we have worked with partners to establish a new pilot service to seek to help people overcome chronic loneliness — Reconnections. Working with a range of partners, we have been developing an approach in Worcestershire which supports the lonely older people to reengage with others. To provide a single point of referral so that community organisations, social workers, family members can easily link people up with support. To mobilise hundreds of volunteers to work alongside people for six to nine months to help rebuild their confidence and reengage with activities and others. And to seek to establish a culture of mutual support in which those helped go on to help others.</p><p>With around 1,000 older people now engaged in Reconnections, we are confident that at the end of support the majority will report being less lonely, and that people are still less lonely after 18 months — although some slip back somewhat. Anecdotally, many people also report getting healthier and using health services less frequently, although we are yet to get the first findings of a full-scale study on people’s use of health services over time.</p><p>But the process of establishing such a service has not been easy. Raising awareness among busy GPs or social workers takes time. When they engage with older people, loneliness is often just one of a host of emotional, practical and medical challenges they are facing — more than a volunteer can address on his or her own. Nor is ‘organising’ a response to loneliness across a whole county straightforward. It rests on both a high quality ‘professional’ infrastructure of training volunteers, supervising good practice, capturing and applying learning, whilst also keeping a focus on people’s individual needs and aspirations and being rooted in a culture of gift and mutual support.</p><p>Supporting people to overcome chronic loneliness takes some time and resource, and isn’t always successful. Reconnections costs around £750 per person at the moment. This is cheap in medical terms — about half the cost to the NHS of someone having their tonsils removed or a tenth of the cost of a hip replacement — and potentially more valuable to people’s overall health and wellbeing. With further innovation, such as shifting more support and administration online, the cost should fall further. Yet in public health terms it would still be a significant pressure on resources. Further, waiting for people to reach such a chronic condition for it to be noticed is surely not optimal for them or for society as a whole.</p><p>We therefore need a dual strategy. We need to keep innovating to find better ways to specifically help people overcome chronic loneliness, refining and developing approaches such as Reconnections. And we need to take a much wider approach to preventing loneliness, by recognising that it is one of the many benefits to arise from investing in our social and community infrastructure and reinforcing the fabric of our society.</p><p>That strengthening of our social fabric rests on careful collective weaving. Of laying down the warp of community institutions around which the weft of informal friendships and mutual support can be threaded: local sports clubs; local social groups; schools which involve the whole community; festivity and arts; even community pubs and inclusive social media. In addition to helping prevent loneliness, it would benefit us all. These networks and institutions help young people navigate adolescence, and parents looking after small children. They reinforce a sense of common identity and purpose, and provide opportunities for meaningful political debate.</p><p>My hope is that, over 2018, national and local government, civil society and businesses will therefore put renewed effort into this drive to weave a stronger and richer social fabric. This will require new resources, as the Lottery provided new resources in the early 1990s — perhaps a super tax on social media advertising to raise £1 billion per annum, or hypothecated proportion of inheritance tax. It will require better incentives — for example on schools to play a greater role as community hubs. And it will require tens of thousands of individuals to look outwards, to better engage those around us and hopefully have fun in the process — from getting involved in local sports groups to tapping into the experience of our older neighbours and family members.</p><p>Jo Cox strikes me as someone who was interested in both supporting the most vulnerable overcome adversity and in helping build a society which avoids such problems in the first instance. Putting both into practice in seeking to tackle loneliness would be a fitting legacy.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=20fd213afec6" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/addressing-loneliness-reflecting-on-reconnections-20fd213afec6">Addressing loneliness — reflecting on Reconnections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These vulnerable young people and their families will be offered access to therapeutic programmes designed to help address the young person’s behavioural issues and improve how the family functions. These programmes are intensive, holistic interventions, based on rigorous evidence. <br> <br>The initiative will utilise three specialist delivery partners, who collectively bring decades of experience of implementing evidence-based programmes across the UK: Family Psychology Mutual, Family Action, and the South West London &amp; St George’s Mental Health NHS Trust. <br> <br>It has been structured as a social outcomes contract, which means Positive Families Partnership will be paid only if it succeeds in meeting certain milestones related to keeping the young person with their family and out of care. <br> <br>Positive Families Partnership will benefit from management support from Social Finance UK and Bridges Fund Management, with the latter also providing over £4.5m to cover the up-front costs of the programme via a social impact bond. <br> <br>The programme will be managed by the London Borough of Sutton, and will operate initially in the five London Boroughs. If successful, the partners hope to scale up their innovative work by rolling it out to other boroughs over time. <br> <br> <br>Brigitte Squire, Programme Manager of Positive Families Partnership, said: “All of us believe these two therapies are the best way of keeping these vulnerable young people with their families and out of care. This pioneering new contract allows us to bring together three of the best delivery partners in the sector and provide a real solution to a pressing social challenge at scale. We look forward to proving the model in the coming years.” <br> <br>David Burnett, Chair of Positive Families Partnership, said: “When a similar programme was trialled in Essex, we found that the outcomes contract structure allowed us to invest in improving the way these therapies were delivered. This new partnership will allow us to draw on the lessons learned in Essex to deliver even better outcomes for these families.” <br>Cllr Ruth Dombey, Leader of Sutton Council, said: “Finding better solutions for these young people has become one of our biggest challenges. So we’re really proud that we have been able to join forces with our colleagues in such an innovative project. We believe it has real potential to show that when commissioning children’s services, innovation and collaboration can help find new solutions to some of our most difficult social challenges.” <br> <br>Mila Lukic, Investment Director at Bridges, said: “We know from our previous experience of working with contracts in this area that these therapies work — if you give the delivery organisations the flexibility and the resources they need to succeed. The outcomes contract structure allows us to do that. We believe this will enable us to deliver better value for these innovative local authorities — and crucially, better outcomes for some of the most vulnerable young people in London.” <br> <br>Lisa Barclay, COO at Social Finance, said: “There are 10,000 children in care in London. With support, many of these young people could stay safely with their families at home. By bringing London boroughs together to access different therapies and programmes, we will be able to transform the lives of hundreds of children and their families across the city.” <br> <br> <br>-END- <br> <br> <br>CONTACT <br> <br>Jonny or Rosie @ The PR Office +44 (0)20 7284 6969</li></ul><p>NOTES TO EDITORS <br> <br>About Bridges Fund Management (bridgesfundmanagement.com) <br>Bridges Fund Management (formerly Bridges Ventures) is a specialist fund manager focused exclusively on sustainable and impact investment, with offices in London and New York.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday, 14th December 2017</p><p><em>By Killian Troy-Donovan, Analyst at Social Finance</em></p><p>In an effort to improve educational attainment in Liberia, Social Finance is supporting the Government of Liberia, and several funding partners, to manage and finance the Partnership School for Liberia (PSL) programme. PSL aims to bring free, quality education to Liberian children through a ‘marketplace’ of government-regulated, high-performing school operators.</p><p><em>This is a diary from the past week that I spent visiting PSL schools from the rural River Cess County to inner-city Monrovia, joining our Liberian verification team for part of their five-day trip.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/433/1*zchmXOvBnIqWk8uggmFlVg.png" /><figcaption><em>The team before we set off from Paynesville in Monrovia, Montserrado</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Day 1: Barclayville</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/432/1*XWw3J9axHL4hZZ_FyvAW9w.png" /><figcaption><em>School #1, Barclayville, Grand Bassa County</em></figcaption></figure><p>We set off for Grand Bassa County on Sunday afternoon, in order to make sure we get to our first school in time for the start of Monday morning classes.</p><p>Along the coastal roads, we are constantly reminded of the impact of the Ebola epidemic, which only came to an end in 2016.<em> </em>Police officers stand at checkpoints bordering each county, monitoring the temperatures of travellers for indication of the virus, while large banners branded by a familiar array of aid agencies warn people to remain vigilant.</p><p>The verification team, Romelus and James, tell me how Ebola united rather than divided the country. Its spread forced people to communicate across communities, and sometimes languages, leaving behind a greater sense of shared responsibility for the nation’s wellbeing.</p><p>On Monday morning, we arrive at Barclayville, a Bridge-operated school in Grand Bassa. We are met by Principal Soloman Higgins, who takes us around the classrooms. Here, we see children and young adults buried in textbooks and exercise sheets, concentrating admirably despite the 90% humidity and 30-degree heat.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/414/1*4dXg39DcFpx_ywrlgC4nSg.png" /><figcaption><em>Principal Soloman Higgins of Barclayville School trying to look serious for the photograph</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we tour the school grounds, I ask him what, in his opinion, is the one thing that would help their students in their learning, and we get onto a discussion on feeding. He says that pupils started to leave mid-morning if they were not being fed. Although the World Food Programme supports a feeding programme at the school, the supplies it sent are based on last year’s enrolment numbers. Now the school is a Partnership School, many more children have signed up, resulting in significant food shortages.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/393/1*dBWVUVx-7RPivLjmEf0bLg.png" /><figcaption><em>James, the recorder on our verification team, doing some verifying (of the overgrown school garden)</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Day 2: River Cess</strong></p><p>We spend the night in Buchanan, before setting off the next morning for Siahn Public School in River Cess County, driving down the single road which connects River Cess to the rest of the country.</p><p>It is the dry season in Liberia, and yet there are many times when we stop to tow cars that have become stuck in the mud, or jump out to help push others that are struggling to start.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/299/1*SigYpa729jyl1vcHRcqNLA.png" /><figcaption><em>Paul and me, struggling through the mud on the road to Cestos, the capital of River Cess County</em></figcaption></figure><p>We also see countless groups of children walking along the roadside, making the long journey to school. Many of them carry textbooks and exercise books, while others balance bundles of sticks as they walk (likely firewood to support their school’s feeding programme, I am told.) I wonder how or whether they manage on the long walks to school when it rains, which it does regularly and heavily in River Cess and along the rest of the Atlantic coast.</p><p>By midday, we arrive at Siahn Public School, operated by Rising Academies, where we are greeted by an impressive third grader leading her class in singing the school anthem. “We are Rising, we are Rising,” they chant, “and we never give up.”</p><p>Nursery and Kindergarten classes are invariably bursting with children. The small ones sit around the teacher at the front, and some sit on the laps of their peers when there is no other space.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/371/1*_ct7ISPn7sUJy_HanLsZMg.png" /><figcaption><em>Romelus, the verification lead, doing a headcount in a busy Kindergarten class at Siahn School, River Cess County</em></figcaption></figure><p>Things are rather quieter in later grades, where students sit diligently working on their algebra problems, or responding thoughtfully to questions from the teacher. The challenge is how few kids make it this far in the Liberian education system. Average enrolment for Grade 7 in PSL schools is 14 students, which is less than a quarter of the average Nursery class size.</p><p>The problem is particularly acute for girls. Already, data from school reports submitted at the start of term shows that the proportion of girls declines steadily through the primary grades. We hear stories from providers and principals about the high number of pregnancies, which cause many girls to drop out.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/545/1*48-12c9HWl0RaO2N6WK5ig.png" /><figcaption><em>Some children at Siahn who insisted that I take their photograph, clearly now used to visitors</em></figcaption></figure><p>As is the case in many of the PSL schools that we visit, classes are taught by engaging young teachers, some of whom look not much older than the eldest students.</p><p>The principals both here and at Barclayville tell us how providers have helped in identifying teachers and bringing them into schools — many of them straight from teacher training courses in other parts of the country. Many schools have benefitted in this way from the removal of ‘ghost teachers’ from government payroll, making way for 1,371 new graduates to enter the public school system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*RQt446OrUxmaTIUdw9Fo2g.png" /><figcaption><em>A teacher testing her Kindergarten class on whether they could spell “elephant.” (They could)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we talk to these teachers, several mention the need for more desks and seats in classrooms for students to work from. One option is to bring them in from the capital Monrovia, through large contracts. However, these can be slow to respond to demand and delivery takes time given the challenges of poor roads.</p><p>An alternative option is using the power of the community to support infrastructure improvements and repair classrooms. This can be very effective, as it draws on both the skills of people in the community, and their willingness to contribute to good education for their children.</p><p>However, labour and materials do not come for free. Paul, who has been driving us during the school visits, thinks that a small amount of money would enable local community members to build chairs and desks for students. There is willingness he says, but the schools themselves have no spending power to make decisions locally.</p><p><strong>Day 3: Montserrado</strong></p><p>On the third day, we return to Montserrado to visit Fofee Town School, operated by a third provider, More Than Me (MTM).</p><p>PSL is a multi-operator programme, with 7 providers managing 194 schools between them. One of the huge potential benefits of this structure is the opportunity to share knowledge and examples of best practice between providers, improving performance across the programme — and beyond.</p><p>One of the most tangible examples of this is the textbooks being used at Fofee Town. MTM, who manage 18 schools as part of PSL, are using textbooks developed by Bridge for their early years classes, and those developed by Rising Academies for Grades 1–6. Many teachers and principals tell me how the learning materials are a real boost for the school, and are the most important reason for improved learning outcomes.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/537/1*WGFrYrsOrlv7cYHKO_df4g.png" /><figcaption><em>Girls and boys in the earlier grades holding hands at More Than Me’s Fofee Town School, in Montserrado County</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we leave Siahn, we see one small girl, no older than 7, setting off with her two smaller sisters. She guides them by the hand along the side of the road, balancing each of their exercise books on her head. One of the smaller girls mirrors her older sibling — practicing with a single pencil.</p><p>I ask the eldest if she enjoyed coming to school.</p><p>“Yes,” she says, shyly.</p><p>What do you like about your school?</p><p>“I like my class.”</p><p>Then, after a thoughtful pause, “and I love my teacher.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*V2ShieMizZztigdVNCXQDg.png" /><figcaption><em>Some students enjoying a spacious class in Bumie Kpaja, a Street Child-operated school.</em></figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4a4910be3aa9" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/improving-educational-attainment-in-liberia-4a4910be3aa9">Improving Educational Attainment in Liberia</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.powertochange.org.uk/">Power to Change</a> and <a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/">Social Finance</a> are jointly publishing a report on how Local Authorities can provide financial support for community businesses — and we want to hear from you! We want to identify best practices, share learning, and provide commissioners with actionable recommendations as to how they can best support local community businesses and achieve social impact.</p><p><strong>But what do we mean by community business?</strong> Community businesses are; rooted locally, trading for the benefit of the local community, accountable to those they serve, and benefit their community as a whole. They can take on many forms, from <a href="http://www.powertochange.org.uk/stories/westbury-community-shop/">Community Shops</a> and associations, to <a href="http://www.powertochange.org.uk/stories/cuckmere-community-buses/">local community transport companies</a>. They also face the same financial difficulties as ‘traditional’ businesses. But as community businesses play a crucial role in community cohesion, it is in everybody’s interest to help them thrive — and some Local Authorities have stepped in and done just that.</p><p>A great example of this is The Dolphin Pub in Bishampton, Worcestershire. After it closed down, the local community applied to have Bishampton and Throckmorton Parish Council use its powers to grant the pub ‘Asset of Community Value’ (ACV) status, and asked for advice on how they might buy the pub.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/361/1*gYnJHWL0BaBqF1ifm6mCqA.png" /></figure><p>The Council, suggested that it could play the role of investor, and buy the pub using funds from the Public Works Loan Board. Their application for £300,000 received unanimous support and was ultimately successful. The main requirement for securing the loan was a robust business plan, which demonstrated how the pub would pay back the loan with or without a tenant. A tenant signed a 15-year lease, and the pub is once again a flourishing part of the local community.</p><p>Its not just Local Authorities, and community business in rural areas that have benefitted from new financing models — cities like Hull have been the site of innovation as well. Take for example the Goodwin Development Trust — a Social Enterprise employing 200 local people in Hull.</p><p>The Trust offers a full suite of services, including: Children’s Centres and Nurseries, a state-of-the-art Conference Centre, a Community College, Disability Care Facilities, Sports pitches, a Youth &amp; Arts Centre, Performance Space, and Meeting Rooms, — with further investment planned for the coming year around the construction of the city’s first social eco-housing. The Hull City Council offered the Trust a loan at a fixed 3.5% interest rate for 30 years so that they could break ground on the housing development, which will provide more than 40 new homes to the community.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/520/1*92mW33kTRtGEC0i0TNlYMg.png" /></figure><p>Typically, Local Authorities do not see themselves as investors — but why not? They are one of the largest stakeholders to local businesses, and commissioners are continually looking for innovative ways of driving social impact; particularly attractive where capital can be repaid! As traditional forms of financing — grant funding — is drying up, some Local Authorities are considering other options such as loans, or equity participation, to achieve social and economic objectives. With their preferential financing options, Local Authorities could be playing a much larger role in backing their local community businesses given the local value they generate.</p><p>We are interested in those ‘traditional’ approaches, and other ‘finance-like’ support for community businesses, including supportive asset management, legal structuring support, or commissioning for public value, and innovative partnerships.</p><p>So, what other examples of Local Authorities supporting community businesses are there? Are there examples of Local Authorities that tried to help but weren’t able to do what they set out to do? We think we can learn from both successful and less successful cases, to also look at how Local Authorities can use their financial fire power in new ways.</p><p>We want to hear from you! Whether you have an example of this specifically, something similar, or are just interested, please get in touch before the end of December:</p><p>Stefan Pagura — <a href="mailto:Stefan.pagura@socialfinance.org.uk">Stefan.pagura@socialfinance.org.uk</a></p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Z��q)ZxЄ��</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=681ba47aab7e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/power-to-change-and-social-finance-are-jointly-publishing-a-report-on-how-local-authorities-can-681ba47aab7e">Whose Round is it this time?

It manages three investment funds</p><p>· Global network set up with Social Finance US (est. 2011) and Social Finance Israel (est.2013)</p><p>Social Finance was set up in 2007 in London. Over the past decade, it has brought together a 70 person team from the voluntary, governmental, tech and financial sectors to develop a fresh approach to difficult social problems. Its model of social change is based on developing partnerships across the voluntary, public and private sectors to address the underlying issues to improve vulnerable people’s lives.</p><p>It focuses on social problems where outcomes are poor, where the system is acknowledged to be failing, where the costs of failure are high and where there is an appetite for change. It has developed a unique method to develop new models by combining analysis, data, collaboration and an investment mind-set.</p><p>David Blood, Chair of Social Finance, said: “The achievements of Social Finance in its first ten years are significant. It has challenged the status quo, made a major contribution to the global impact investment market and incubated new models of change to tackle important social issues. Given the scale of social challenges, the need for new approaches has never been greater.”</p><p>As it looks to its next decade, Social Finance hopes to scale its impact through different routes.</p><p>1) National expansion of programmes such as its Health and Employment Partnerships to support people with health challenges back into work</p><p>2) Regional clusters of Social Impact Bonds to support children on the edge of care and youth at risk of unemployment</p><p>3) Adoption of data analysis and predictive tools to support local authorities, particularly for looked after children and vulnerable adults</p><p>4) Take up of new financial models developed by Social Finance, including the Future Parks model with the National Trust and local authority housing portfolios to provide housing for homeless families</p><p>5) International adoption of results based models and Impact Bonds to improve education, health and employment in low-middle income countries</p><p>David Hutchison, CEO, Social Finance, said: <em>“It has been exciting to be part of building Social Finance over the past decade. Across all our projects, we have been privileged to work with committed partners, whether from government, the social sector or investors, to make change happen.

A number of donor-backed projects with a PbR component have been launched in the global education sector, offering an opportunity to reflect and learn from them. These PbR mechanisms have the potential to allow for greater adaptability in service delivery and for decision-making based on data and evidence,</p><p>But PbR is a generic term. <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> While all PbR funding structures pay a portion or all of programme funding only if pre-defined results are achieved, there are big variations in the way PbR contracts are designed. In some ‘results-based’ funding models, implementers are nevertheless paid a significant portion of their contract value on an input basis (i.e. for activities delivered); in others, implementers are paid ex-post for results but bear the financial risk of results being achieved. In others again, external investors provide up-front working capital and take on the financial risk that results are achieved — a model now popularised as ‘Development Impact Bonds’.</p><p>This range of contracting structures can be stripped down to two basic elements:</p><p>· The proportion of financing to providers where the risk of non-delivery is moved away from the funder (i.e. the risk sits with the service provider or external investors)</p><p>· The extent to which results-based payments are linked to activities, outputs or outcomes.</p><p>In our work at Social Finance in designing PbR instruments, we emphasise the importance of bringing in external investors to bear risk where feasible, and linking payments to outcomes to the extent possible. A common insight from channelling funds in this way is that it requires a cultural shift and changes the way that stakeholders work and think about programme management and implementation. Organisations experimenting with this type of funding model report that organisational changes are occurring. In situations where results are defined as outcomes further along the ‘results chain’ and where delivery flexibility is built into the contract, frontline staff are better able to adapt interventions according to what they observe to be working or not and resources are allocated accordingly, rather than budgets and timeframes being set on pre-agreed activities and milestones.</p><p>This particular approach to PbR also raises questions about programme evaluation. While implementers agree that programme results must be verified independently to ensure credibility of results metrics and payment, there is also agreement that the evaluation methodology, level of rigour and resources dedicated to verifying and evaluating results should vary according to the context and nature of the programme being implemented.</p><p>Building on different experiences of PbR in the education sector, we have sought to bring out key features in PbR contract design which make them most effective. While these features are discussed in the context of PbR experiences in global education, they have much broader application to the use of PbR in other social issue areas.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Focus on outcomes</strong></p><p>As much as possible, programmes should focus on outcomes — for example, in education, outcomes which reflect improved learning and quality education. In this way PbR programmes can mark a real shift away from programmes where key metrics have been activities or outputs (such as number of schools constructed, technologies distributed or teachers trained). In some cases, it will be necessary to measure and possibly pay against intermediate outcome metrics, as it will take more time to observe and evaluate changes in longer term outcomes. Programmes should measure results at a disaggregated level to understand whether outcomes have improved, why and how, and for which populations.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Define results metrics that create the right incentives</strong></p><p>Careful thought is required to define payment metrics in ways that do not create perverse incentives. For example, payments should be linked to progress, not only absolute success in reaching a target or not. Moreover, success metrics and payment triggers should be designed to provide incentives for targeting hard to reach and disadvantaged populations, such as by offering higher payments for services delivered to these populations compared to those easier to reach.</p><p>In early PbR projects, defining outcome metrics has often been challenging and time-consuming. However, practitioners report that centring programmes around these metrics has led to a sharper focus on outcomes throughout implementation. Getting the metrics right generates a better understanding of what works, how, and at what cost, and has value to organisations and the sector beyond individual projects. Moreover, these costs are expected to decrease over time with more experience and sharing of best practices.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Allow implementers flexibility to deliver interventions</strong></p><p>Most development challenges are complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. PbR programme implementers have particularly valued the ability to develop and adapt interventions according to what proves to work or not in specific contexts. This implies building flexibility into contracts to ensure that resources can be reallocated as needed and milestones shifted during the course of the programme to maximise outcomes. In our experience, involving external investors who take on the risk of non-delivery can be a critical element in creating</p><p>a ‘safe space’ for service providers to innovate, learn, iterate and adapt.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Adapt organisational structure and decision-making processes</strong></p><p>PbR approaches involve a cultural and organisational shift within provider organisations to allow intervention adaptation to be informed by frontline staff’s observations of what is or is not effectively improving outcomes. In particular, this requires altering decision-making processes to allow some decisions to be made at a level closer to delivery. These changes in structures and decision-making processes indicate that truly testing a PbR model requires different systems and a different mindset — changes which will require time and patience to embed.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Be clear on government’s role</strong></p><p>Governments are key partners in PbR programmes and should be involved from the beginning of the programme’s design, even if they are not a direct funder. As a first step, governments should be engaged in defining key target populations and outcomes, and in developing an understanding of why alternative approaches have failed to deliver the intended outcomes. Governments can be outcomes funders or co-funders, or gradually take over funding as the PbR model demonstrates proof of concept. Importantly, governments can be involved in selecting and supporting implementers and benefiting from lessons learned about how implementers are performing. Learnings generated from PbR programmes should be shared to inform future government policy decisions and programmes.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Independently and robustly verify outcomes</strong></p><p>In order to ensure clear and credible evidence of outcomes achieved, programme results must be verified by an independent and specialised third party before payments for results are triggered. PbR approaches create incentives for quality data collection, which is critical to the evaluation of programmes and determining what works or not. The exact level of rigour required to link payments to results depends on what is measurable in a specific context and the level of attribution that a particular funder requires.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A wide range of other terms are used to describe this approach, including Results-Based Financing, ‘Pay for Success’, Output-Based Aid and others.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=99216827b809" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/can-payment-by-results-approaches-successfully-improve-education-outcomes-99216827b809">Can payment by results approaches successfully improve education outcomes?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KPID4ndtZae_u0e4YBV4Xg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Tuesday, 12 September 2017</p><p><em>By Dominique Carrie, Associate at Social Finance</em></p><p>In the past few months, a few people have asked me what I was doing on a daily basis at Social Finance and I’ve happily told them about what designing an impact bond requires: thinking through the operational model with the service provider and the government as necessary, carefully developing the payment mechanism that outcomes funders would use to compensate investors for the delivery risk they are taking, building a financial model to determine the required budget and possible terms of investment, reaching out to potential investors, preparing term sheets and contracts with all parties, setting up governance and performance management structures that ensure the success of the project, etc. The list of workstreams and tasks is long and the amount of details that one chooses to provide only depends on the audience, their priorities, and level of interest.</p><p>The reality however is that this list gives an incomplete picture of what our work at Social Finance really is all about: bringing people together and aligning their effort towards the same goal, i.e. tackling a specific social challenge.</p><p>The Kangaroo Mother Care Development Impact Bond (DIB) that Social Finance is designing in partnership with the MaRS Centre for Impact Investing is a good example of the importance and challenge of bringing together various stakeholders. For a bit of background on this project, Kangaroo Mother Care is an evidence-based approach to caring for and saving low-birth-weight and preterm newborns who are particularly fragile. It involves long periods of skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding whenever possible, with the caregivers basically becoming the source of nutrition and warmth for the infant. The DIB aims to scale this method in Cameroon through a train-the-trainer model: the Kangaroo Foundation Cameroon trains Centres of Excellence, which in turn train other regional hospitals, thereby institutionalising KMC expertise in the healthcare system.</p><p>So how many stakeholders are we working with?</p><p>First, a DIB requires outcomes funders to guarantee repayments to an investor if the project is successful (i.e. if agreed metrics have been achieved). This DIB has three committed outcomes funders: the <strong>government of Cameroon</strong> (drawing on funds from the <strong>Global Financing Facility</strong> managed by the <strong>World Bank</strong>), and two Canadian non-profits<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> — <strong>Grand Challenges Canada</strong> (GCC) and <strong>Nutrition International</strong> (NI). We’ve been very lucky on this project to be supported by internal champions in each of those organisations, which has been crucial to move the project forward.</p><p>Second, we need a service provider to implement the project: that’s the <strong>Kangaroo Foundation in Cameroon. </strong>As it is still a young foundation, they continue to be supported by the <strong>Kangaroo Foundation in Colombia</strong>, which has been a crucial partner in developing the project thanks to their long experience and strong technical expertise. We shouldn’t forget also to mention that the government of Cameroon is not only providing funding but is also a key player to collaborate with on the operational side since KMC will be deployed in the public healthcare system. This collaboration involves for example allocating medical staff to our project and ensuring the long-term sustainability of KMC beyond the end of the DIB. We also work with a local consultant, <strong>Abongta Moncha</strong>, who supports us on the ground in our discussions with various stakeholders, including the <strong>twelve hospitals</strong> that will likely participate in the DIB. So when we say that we’re “developing the operational model”, what we really mean is that we’re in constant conversation with stakeholders to understand how to best deploy KMC on the ground, how to navigate the local context, and how to engage people on the front line to ensure the long-term success of the programme.</p><p>Then, you have other organisations providing specific skillsets to this project, including <strong>MaRS Centre for Impact Investing </strong>(our Canada-based partner intermediary), pro-bono legal support (from <strong>Morrison &amp; Foerster </strong>and<strong> Miller Thompson</strong>) and local tax and legal support<strong>. </strong>We’re also in the process of contracting a company to develop a data management system for the project as well as an independent evaluator, who will assess hospital records and other sources of information to determine, objectively, whether outcomes have been achieved during the DIB.</p><p>And this list doesn’t take into account the amazing people we regularly draw knowledge from, including for example the project advisory board, and the potential investors we are currently talking to. We’re indeed looking for an organisation to join the project as an investor and as such provide the upfront required capital of up to $2m USD.</p><p>So we’re looking at more than 15 stakeholders (30+ individuals) from at least 4 different countries to collaborate with and regularly update on the project. This definitely comes with challenges as it takes time to update each individual involved in the project (the time difference doesn’t help) but importantly because it takes time to listen to them, understand where they’re coming from, their points of view and the challenges they face, take into account the cultural differences, learn from their experience and discuss how best to move forward together. Once you manage to do it though, it becomes the most rewarding experience, getting closer, step by step, to launching a life-saving intervention as each piece of the puzzle is finalised and agreed on.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1"><em>[1]</em></a><em> The government of Cameroon has committed $2m USD of funds for this project, while GCC and NI have committed $800k USD each, bringing the total outcomes funding available to $3.6m USD</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3d9573d121f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk/scaling-kangaroo-mother-care-in-cameroon-its-all-about-bringing-people-together-3d9573d121f">Scaling Kangaroo Mother Care in Cameroon — It’s all about bringing people together</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/social-finance-uk">Social Finance UK</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
